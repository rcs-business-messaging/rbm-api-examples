# [Google's RCS Business Messaging: Java Client](https://github.com/rcs-business-messaging/rbm-api-examples/tree/master/java/rbm-api-helper)

> **_NOTE:_** This client library is provided as a quick start to get you up and running with RBM. Once you get familiar with the basic functions in this library, we recommend that you unlock all the powerful capabilities of RBM via the RBM API directly.

[RCS Business Messaging](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/rcs-business-messaging/guides/get-started/how-it-works) upgrades SMS with branding, rich media, interactivity,
and analytics. With RCS, businesses can bring branded, interactive mobile experiences, right to the native Android messaging app.

This document contains an [API reference](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/rcs-business-messaging/reference/rest), samples,
and other resources useful to developing Java applications. For additional help developing RCS Business Messaging applications, in Node.js and
other languages, see our [RCS Business Messages quickstart](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/rcs-business-messaging/guides/get-started/first-agent)
guide.

## Documentation

The documentation for the RCS Business Messaging API can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/rcs-business-messaging/reference/rest).

## Getting Started


### Usage

We recommend you use the latest version available
in the Maven repositories. Add the following to you `pom.xml`:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.rbm</groupId>
  <artifactId>rbm-api-helper</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.2</version>
</dependency>
```

(Update for the latest version).

### Install into your local repository

You can build and install a local copy of this library with:

```
mvn install
```

### Explore the Java samples

Explore the Java samples in `../agents` to see how the helper library is used.

### Before you begin

1.  [Register with RCS Business Messaging](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/rcs-business-messaging/guides/get-started/register-partner).

## Sample usage

Some examples of using the helper library:

### Initialisation
Since release 1.0.1, can optionally initialise the library to use a specific regional endpoint.

You also need to specify the agent id (without `@rbm.goog`) you are representing.

```java
import com.google.rbm.RbmApiHelper;

rbmApiHelper = new RbmApiHelper();
// rbmApiHelper = new RbmApiHelper(RbmApiHelper.REGION_APAC);
// rbmApiHelper = new RbmApiHelper(RbmApiHelper.REGION_US);
// rbmApiHelper = new RbmApiHelper(RbmApiHelper.REGION_EU);

rbmApiHelper.setAgentId("myagentid");
```

### Registering a tester

```java
try {
  rbmApiHelper.registerTester(msisdn);
} catch (Exception e) {
  e.printStackTrace();
}
```

### Sending a message

```java
try {
  rbmApiHelper.sendTextMessage("What is your favorite color?", msisdn);
} catch (IOException e) {
  e.printStackTrace();
}
```

## Versioning

This library follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

This library is considered to be **General Availability (GA)**. This means it
is stable; the code surface will not change in backwards-incompatible ways
unless absolutely necessary (e.g. because of critical security issues) or with
an extensive deprecation period. Issues and requests against **GA** libraries
are addressed with the highest priority.
