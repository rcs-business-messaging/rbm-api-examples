/**
 * Compose and send a message to a destination predefined by chatbot. To check whether a user's
 * device supports this action, run a capability check first. See the documentation for details:
 * https://developers.google.com/business-communications/rcs-business-
 * messaging/guides/build/capabilities. Caution: Carriers have raised concerns about the current
 * definition and implementation of the Compose action as outlined in the GSMA specification. Given
 * these concerns, and to ensure a consistent and reliable experience for users and the ecosystem,
 * we have made the exceptional decision to pause the rollout of the Compose action. We'll remove
 * the documentation about Compose actions on **June 05, 2025**. We understand that rolling back an
 * API feature is not standard practice; this decision reflects the importance we place on
 * addressing partner feedback and maintaining the stability and integrity of the RBM platform.
 * Please reach out to your Google RBM contact if the Compose action is important for your use
 * cases.
